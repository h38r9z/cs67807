SOC 20004/30004:
Introduction to Quantitative Methods in Social   Science
Final Project
Due December   12, 2024
This assignment is based on the Early Childhood Longitudinal   Study Kindergarten   Cohort,   1998   (ECLSK 98), a nationally representative sample of   US children   entering kindergarten   in   1998.
The assignment follows from a preliminary analysis you completed   for   assignment   2.   In   that   study, you looked at bivariate relationships between the social origins of   a   child   and that   child’s   early mathematics skill. We chose this outcome because it is known   to predict   later   school   success   – which   itself   predicts   adult   economic   outcomes.
What   is   new   in   this   final   project   is   the   task   of   modeling   these   relationships.
The data set name on canvas is “ECLS_98_Soc30004_revised.dta.” We’ll   confine   our   interest to the following   variables:
B_MOMEDW = mother’s education   POV= family’spoverty   status
ln_income (treat as interval   scale)
R4MTHT_R=child’s   math   score   in   fall   of   kindergarten
R4MTHT_0=child’s   math   score   in   spring   of   kindergarten
Please write a report not to exceed   10 double-spaced pages (including tables   and   figures) that   answers the following questions:
1.       To what extent do social   origins   (mothers   ’   education,   family poverty   status,   and   income   (log scale) predict a ch代 写SOC 20004/30004: Introduction to Quantitative Methods in Social ScienceR

2.          To what extent does the child’s math   skill   at   entry to   kindergarten predict   that   child’s   math skill in the spring of   kindergarten, controlling   for the   social   origin variables?
3. All findings in social science are based   on   some   assumptions   regardless   of   how   carefully   the analysis is done. Please state any   assumptions that   are required   to   justify   your   answers   to questions (1) and (2). Also, please evaluate the credibility of   these   assumptions with   respect   your findings in this study. (Use plots to evaluate these assumptions when   possible.)
Your report should define key variables used in the analysis and provide   a table of   basic
descriptive statistics. Please use multiple regression to answer these questions. Please write   down   any   models that you study. Define each term in the model. Please describe key   findings with   language   accessible   to   a   policy   maker   or   practitioner. (Although   pvalues   are   relevant, do   not   rely   primarily   on computed   p   values   to   interpret   your   findings. If   a   relationship   is   “statistically   significant,” interpret the magnitude of   the regression coefficients themselves.) In a final paragraph, briefly   summarize your key conclusions.
